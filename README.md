### About me
I have Twenty years of experience working in the delivery of software and infrastructure to support change to business processes and systems. I have worked for end user organisations and for software houses across a number of sectors including retail, manufacturing, higher education and financial services. Iâ€™ve worked in a variety of roles including pre-sales and implementation consultancy, business and systems analysis, technical lead, line manager, scrum master and agile delivery lead. Iâ€™m passionate about the impact well implemented IT systems and processes can have on people and organisations.

I am a former international athlete competing for Great Britain at a junior level at sprint and marathon kayaking, winning many national titles and came 9th in the Junior World Marathon Championships. I am also passionate about supporting charitable causes, following university, I wanted to experience conservation and third world development. I volunteered for Students Partnerships Worldwide. I had to raise Â£2,500 to take part. I spent six months in Uganda learning and then teaching sustainable organic farming in a remote village. Since then I have raised nearly Â£20,000 for other causes by taking on endurance challenges from cycling from Lands End to John Oâ€™Groats to completing the national three peaks challenge.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
I am currently on a software engineering bootcamp. During the bootcamp Iâ€™ll be learning the
following skills:
- Learning to code in Python
- How to create webpages using HTML and styling them with CSS as well as learning how
to do this faster with Bootstrap
- Using Django to build web applications
- How to build databases using SQL, MySQL and SQLite and get applications built using
python to interact with them.

Iâ€™ll also be learning how to design, plan, build, test, debug, refactor, deploy and maintain a
software system as well as how to use Git for version control.
